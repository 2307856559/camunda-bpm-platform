/**
 * This class encapsulates legacy runtime behavior for the process engine.
 *<p>
 * Since 7.3 the behavior of certain bpmn elements has changed slightly.
 *<p>
 *
 * 1. Some elements which did not used to be scopes are now scopes:
 * <ul>
 *  <li>Sequential multi instance Embedded Subprocess: is now a scope, used to be non-scope.</li>
 *  <li>Event subprocess: is now a scope, used to be non-scope.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * 2. In certain situations, executions which were both scope and concurrent were created.
 * This used to be the case if a scope execution already had a single scope child execution
 * and then concurrency was introduced (by a on interrupting boundary event or
 * a non-interrupting event subprocess).  In that case the existing scope execution
 * was made concurrent. Starting from 7.3 this behavior is considered legacy.
 * The new behavior is that the existing scope execution will not be made concurrent, instead,
 * a new, concurrent execution will be created and be interleaved between the parent and the
 * existing scope execution.
 *<p>
 * WARNING: Legacy behavior must not be turned off as a rolling upgrade.
 * All process engines connected to the database need to be shut down and then the legacy
 * behavior needs to be turned off.
 *
 * @author Daniel Meyer
 * @since 7.3
